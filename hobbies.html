         <h1>Hobbies & Skills</h1>
         <p>I have a couple of things that i do for fun.</p>
         <h2>Rugby</h2>
         <p><img src="pic/rugby.jpeg" width="200"></p>
         <p>One of my best hobbies and is playing rugby.Though there are many reasons why I play rugby, having fun is my main reason.<br>
            The aggression and intensity of the game without doubt makes the game interesting and keeps the adrenaline pumping <br>
            being both my hobby and skill.</p>
            <h2>Video Games</h2>
            <p><img src="pic/timmy.jpeg" width="250"></p>
            <p>Playing video games is another of my hobbies and unlike rugby it lures me into the <em>fantasy</em> world which makes <br>
               it even more fun. Also unlike rugby you get to have fun at the comfort of the couch.</p>
               <h2>Movies</h2>
               <p><img src="pic/minion.jpeg" width="250"></p>
               <p>What makes watching movies so interesting is the fact that it brings out different emotions depending on the scene. <br>
                  The most fun part is that it allows you to fantasize and imagine what you could do in that world or situation.<br>
                   Watching movies is also one of my hobbies.</p>
